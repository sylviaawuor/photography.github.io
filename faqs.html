                                        <p>Newborn Photography sessions are best booked in the start of your third trimester. You should book at least 4-6 weeks as only a limited number of newborns are scheduled each month to ensure I am free to accommodate all of them once they arrive.</p>

                                        <p>Newborn Sessions are best when your infant is within the first 15 days of birth. It is so easy in the excitement of bringing home the little angel to forget or let time pass you by but timing is really critical in scheduling your newborn session. I ask that all my clients to notify me within 3 days of your baby's birth to ensure getting you on the schedule within those first precious days of your new baby's life.</p>

                                    <div class="submenu2">
                                        <p>During 5-15 days, the newborns are the most sleepy and curly so we can get them in those adorable squishy poses.  Also, baby acne tends to kick in around the 2nd week and while I will retouch blemishes out of your final images, excessive acne can be difficult to remove entirely.  While I really encourage and prefer that we do the session within 2 weeks I realize that sometimes there are reasons that the session cannot be done within this time frame.  Should this happen, I will still photograph "older" newborns, however, some of those desired posed/sleepy baby shots may not happen.</p>

                                        <p>I highly suggest booking your session during your third trimester to guarantee yourself a spot on my newborn list.  I can only take a limited amount each  month. Obviously many babies are not often born on their due date. So we will just use your due date as a rough estimate.   Once your baby is born, you will need to notify me within a couple days after birth so we can schedule your actual date/time.</p>

                                    <div class="submenu2">
                                        <p>Sure!  Personal items will make your photos all the more special to you.  However, I suggest not more than 2 props because I do have an ample supply of props/headbands/hats/sets that I've accumulated that match my style of photography, the backdrops, and work with the flow of the session.  My sets are designed to fit and photograph beautifully on newborns.  Be sure to try on the prop prior to your session to make sure it fits, often times hats are way too big or tutus will irritate baby.  I do have plenty of adorable hats/headbands/sets that are custom designed to fit brand-new babies so don't worry if you don't have anything.</p>

                                        <p>Yes, requests or inspirations for shots are great!  That being said, while I do appreciate ideas and inspiration, I will not replicate or copy someone else's work.   I have spent time establishing my own style, so be sure you've looked through my site so you can get a feel for my images.   It is also my priority to keep babies safe, so I will not position newborn babies in any manner that will cause them any harm or make them unhappy.</p>

Many shots are duplicates so the best of these sets will be chosen.  On occasion if we have a baby that super cooperative I will have many extra shots.  If this is the case, these images will show up in your gallery and you will have opportunity to purchase them.</p>
