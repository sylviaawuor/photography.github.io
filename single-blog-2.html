            <h1>Acid reflux in babies</h1>

        <div class="post-content">

            <p>I was so excited to leave the hospital after delivery. I literally hate hospitals (who loves hospitals, anyway?) Anyway, the first night at home was so relaxing. I literally blacked out the better part of the night as it was silent and dark. There were no bells or phones ringing, no lights were on, and no ambulance sirens in the wee hours of the nights. I kept waking up to check on my baby then and again, let's just say, I was blessed with a very calm baby.</p>

            <p>My milk flow was way past her demand and I would get the urge to pump now and again to relieve pressure off them. After a week of careful healthy eating and avoiding foods that cause gas in babies, heaven broke loose. My daughter started throwing up, you know the one that would gush out like a fountain from both the mouth and her nose? I would hold her upright after a feed for more than 15-20mins like everyone advised me to but it persisted and got scary as the days passed by. Sometimes she would even wake up to throw up when she was asleep. I would need to change her clothes and beddings 4-5 times a day. I started getting worried of her chocking, to an extent I would sit and watch her sleep
                in-case she throws up. I made sure I don't drift off to deep sleep just so I could hear her. We had to sleep with the lights on and would jump up to peep on her throughout the night. I dreaded leaving her by herself even to have a shower because I didn't trust that anyone would be able to handle her in-case she threw up.</p>
            <p>We had gone for her 6 weeks clinic review and the Pediatrician assured me it was just reflux and she requested I keep off all dairy products. Back at home, all I had was plain hot chocolate and soups. I felt my body getting weaker, but I told myself, as long as the milk supply is good and my daughter is well, the rest I shall recover when she starts to wean.</p>
            <p>Did cutting off dairy make it better? No, the throwing up persisted, there was once I lifted her up when she had started to throw up and it blocked her nose. She choked and started wheezing even after I cleaned nose. My world broke apart. I would just sit down and cry my eye balls out. I literally felt like I was losing it!</p>

            <p>There must be a specialist for these kinds of things. I then got a recommendation for Dr. Laving Ahmed who I would recommend to all the mothers with babies going through this. He was the only one who understood what my baby was going through and gave us the remedy.
                No, holding the baby up for 30 Mins after feeding won't help, neither is it that you're overfeeding your baby.</p>
            <p>Dr. Laving is a Paediatric Gastroenterologist with a clinic in Aga Khan. You can book an appointment through +254 (724) 940 616. I would also advise first time mothers to make an appointment right before weaning starts at 6 Months.</p>
